### Statistics are a key tool of a Data Engineer. 

#### So what are the definitions of these measures of data??

##### Count?
A count of how many items you have

##### Range of the dataset?
The difference between the largest value and the smallest value

##### Mean?
The average of a data set

##### Variance?
Variance measures how far a data set is spread out. 
It is mathematically defined as the average of the squared differences from the mean.

##### Median?
The middle of the set of numbers

##### Mode?
The value that appears most frequently in a data set

##### Standard Deviation?
A measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values.
** A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set.
** A high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range.

##### Standard Error of the Mean?
SEM measures how far the sample mean (average) of the data is likely to be from the true population mean

### What do these measures tell you about the dataset if:

##### the measure is a large number?

##### the measure is a very small?

Typically, any low amount of these numbers means a smaller/tighter data set.
